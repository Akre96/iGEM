Your directory needs to look like:

app.py
UPLOAD_FOLDER
script.py
red.hmm
blue.hmm
yellow.hmm
templates
	file.html
	index.html


Also, you may need to install hmmer for yours to work. (brew install hmmer)

Let me know if you have any questions. 
Also, the output isn't normally one code block. Its all on new lines in my python code-- its how I passed the variable in flask that makes it do that and I couldnt fix it :(
